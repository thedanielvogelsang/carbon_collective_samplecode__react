# README

This repo samples javascript code from the frontend User Interface for the production-level version of my recent employers alpha product, constructed using the React framework. This React app is used to display user data related to household energy-intensive activities (water, heat, and electricity bills) via an attractive and unique UX featuring d3 visualizations. It is dependent upon fetch calls to a supportive JSON-returning backend API.

The sample code includes a well-constructed (in my opinion!), modular approach to an advanced React component tree juggling lots of complex static data. Components were always built with future replication/reusability in mind. Additionally, the app employs Redux to manage state, React-Router(-redux) for routing, as well as several other npm packages/dependencies such as fontawesome, materialUI, & react-expandable-listview for advanced features and icons/styling. Data visualizations were made possible by D3 javascript. The apps functionality is dependent upon fetch calls to a supportive backend API, and together with its counterpart applications (including the RAILS backend and AWS userlog system) make up the alpha launch for Carbon Collective.
